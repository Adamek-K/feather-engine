RigidEntities are a child class of Entities that have physics attributes (collision, forces, etc.)

--Instantiation--
Refer to Create() method in Entity. Additionally, Clone() is overloaded so RigidEntities can be created directly.
Refer to Destroy() method in Entity for deconstructing.



--Members--
Vector: force, velocity, acceleration
SDL_Rect: hitBox
float: gravity, mass

These members are used in calculation for how the transform.position member should be affected following a change in time.
They are also public, and can be modified as needed.



--Adding Forces--

    int addForce(Vector force);
	int addForceX(float x);
	int addForceY(float Y);

More modifier functions may be added as variables migrate to private/protected territory.



--Setting the hitbox--

    int setHitbox(int x = 0, int y = 0, int w = 1, int h = 1);

Creates a SDL_Rect, collision is handled by SDL_HasIntersection() which takes this as a parameter.



--Update--
Calling Update() takes one parameter, deltaTime, which is handled in main.
Using this deltaTime, the position is calculated, using the change in position in conjunction with hitBox to first determine
whether or not a collision will occur (testMove()). If no collision is detected, transform.position is updated accordingly.
