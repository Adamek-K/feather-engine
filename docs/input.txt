Keyboard input is handled in feather through just one function currently, although more are planned in the future. This function is the isKeyHeld() function, which returns true when a certain key is held and false if it isn't. It takes an integer for the key to check. Shorthands for the int are currently defined for a few different keys, and more are planned. The currently available keys are Key_Up, Key_Down, Key_Left, Key_Right, and Key_Space, representing the arrow keys and space key.

EXAMPLE

void onFrame(){
	if(isKeyHeld(KeyUp)){
		//Do omething
	}
	if(isKeyHeld(KeyDown)){
		//Do something else
	}
}

Basic mouse input can be done through the function getMousePosition(), which returns an array of 2 integers (an x and a y) representing the position of the mouse. 

EXAMPLE

int[2] mousePosition;
void onFrame(){
	mousePosition = getMousePosition();
	int x = mousePosition[0];
	int y = mousePosition[1];
}
