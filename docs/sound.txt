Feather has support for playing music and sound effects in your games through the use of a few simple functions.

--Music--
To play music, simply use the function swapMusic(). swapMusic() takes in just one argument - a path to the song you want to play.

EXAMPLE

void Begin(){
	swapMusic("assets/song.mp3");
}

Music will loop by default, and can be paused with the pauseMusic() and resumeMusic() functions, both of which take no arguments.

--Sound Effects--
There is just one function related to playing sound effects - playSound(). This function takes 2 arguments: a path to a sound to be played (which must be a .wav) and an integer for the sound channel to play it on. You can use -1 if you have no preference for a channel to play it on.

EXAMPLE

void Begin(){
	playSound("assets/sound.wav", -1);
}
