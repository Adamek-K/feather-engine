Feather currently contains 2 basic debugging functions - Log() and Crash(). Both of them take just one argument - some text - and print it to the terminal. Crash() also shuts down the game and provides some extra information while doing this.

EXAMPLE

void Begin(){
	Log("Game Beggining");
	Crash("Game Ending);
}
