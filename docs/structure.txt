This section of the documentation serves as an outline for the basic structure of a project, and the engine as a whole.

docs/

The docs directory holds all the documentation for the game engine. If you are looking to learn about the game engine, or want to learn about a certain feature, this is where info about it will be.

include/

This directory is planned to actually contain the SDL libraries itself, although currently it is empty and just a placeholder.

feather/

The feather directory contains all the code for the engine itself. If you want to modify any of the backend code of the engine or implement a new feature, or just study it for fun, take a look here. This is also where the main function is.

assets/

This directory is designed to hold all game assets, although that isn't enforced (yet). Images, music, sounds, etc. will all go in this directory.

modules/

Another placeholder directory, this one designed for when the engine becomes more modular and the ability to load external "add-ons" becomes easier. For now, it is just empty.

game.cpp

The game.cpp file contains all of the game logic itself, including the 3 main functions Begin(), onFrame(), and End(). When you are actually making a game, this is the file you will be editing.

PROJECT.h

PROJECT.h is a file that contains some variables used by the game engine that are designed to modified externally (for example, window options).
