## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
Git,
Python

To get started clone Feather by running `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Adamek-K/feather-engine.git`

Currently feather uses SCons as its build system, to get SCons run `python -m pip install scons`

Confirm it is installed by running `scons --version`

Now navigate into the feather-engine folder and run scons
Note: There should be a compiler like gcc, msvc or mingw installed for this to work

Scons should start building and you should have an executable called "game", run it.
If you get a blue window then great! You have successfully built feather!


Once you have feather built you can check out the examples in the example directory.
These examples explain how to use Feather to make games.

Currently there are 2 examples namely game and mouse_game.
